tags and store app are independent modules

So to decouple them we use another app : core which interacts with both and acts as bridge between multiple apps related to store


USER LOGIC:
    their are 2 types of USER:
    1) User Specific to app : (PROFILE) ( I case od store the user is 'Customer')
    2) User For django default auth (which is in case inside thw 'core' app which isspecific to project)

    When user register, system will generate user_id (using core auth module) which include necesary details like (username, password) {i.e data only required for login}
    Other data like DOB, name,etc that is not necessary for user registration or login will be associated with user profile (CUSTOMER for store app)

    This User profile of CUSTOMER of store will contain a ForeignKey to the USER_ID of default Auth app (In this Case 'Core.Auth' {check for 'AUTH_USER_MODEL' in settings.py )
